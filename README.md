# Java Swing - Home Drawing

This Java program employs Swing to create a graphical application that draws a simple representation of a house. The graphical user interface consists of a JFrame titled "Home" and a custom JPanel named Home responsible for drawing the house components.

**Home Class:**

1) Extends JPanel to create a custom panel for drawing.
2) Overrides the paintComponent method to draw various shapes representing a house, including a triangle (roof), a big square (main body), a window, and a door.
3) Utilizes Graphics methods for drawing and styling, such as drawPolygon and drawRect to draw shapes with different colors.

**Main Class:**

1) Creates a JFrame titled "Home."
2) Sets up the frame with a size of 200x200 pixels.
3) Adds an instance of the Home class to the frame.
4) Displays the frame to visualize the drawn house.

The program provides a simple example of using Java Swing for GUI development, demonstrating how to draw basic shapes to create a visual representation of a house. It is suitable for educational purposes, especially for those learning about GUI programming or exploring basic drawing functionalities. Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different shapes, colors, or additional elements to enhance the representation of the house.
