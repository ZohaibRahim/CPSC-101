# Computer Programming

This Java program, consisting of two classes (NumberToStringConvertor and Testing), implements a static method numberToString(int n) that converts an integer between 1 (inclusive) and one billion (exclusive) into its word representation. The numberToString method provides coverage for a broader range of integers, and it takes appropriate action if the argument is out of range.

The NumberToStringConvertor class includes various static methods for converting different ranges of numbers into words. It covers units, tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, and beyond. The Testing class contains an automated testing method that evaluates the numberToString method with a range of edge cases.

Usage:

The NumberToStringConvertor class contains the primary method numberToString(int n) for converting integers to words.
The Testing class provides automated test cases to verify the correctness of the conversion method.
