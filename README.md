**Card Game Utility - Counting Fifteens**

This Java program provides utility classes for working with a standard deck of playing cards. The primary classes include Card, Rank, and Suit. The Card class represents a playing card with methods for obtaining the card's rank, suit, crib count, and string representation. The Rank and Suit enumerations define the possible ranks and suits of the cards.

The program also includes two test classes: Test15s and TestCard.

Test15s:

Reads input lines containing space-separated card representations.
Creates card objects and populates a hand with them.
Computes the number of combinations in the hand that sum up to 15 crib count.
Outputs the original hand and the count of fifteen crib counts.
TestCard:

Reads input lines containing space-separated card representations.
Creates card objects and calculates the total crib count for the hand.
Outputs the original hand and the total crib count.
These classes can be used to analyze hands of playing cards, particularly in the context of card games where the goal is to achieve specific crib counts, such as in the game of cribbage.
