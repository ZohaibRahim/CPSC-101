# Computer Programming

This Java program simulates a murder case scenario involving a group of friends. The main components of the simulation are encapsulated in the Person class, which includes methods for creating persons, managing their life status, causing deaths, tracking murderers, and facilitating interactions like saying hello.

The PersonTester class serves as the test bed for the simulation, creating instances of the Person class and orchestrating a storyline involving conversations and a murder. The simulation outputs the interactions and provides counts of living and deceased persons at different points in the story.

The program explores object-oriented principles, encapsulation, and interactions between objects in a narrative context. It provides a simple example of using Java classes to model and simulate real-world scenarios.
