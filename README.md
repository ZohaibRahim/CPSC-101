# Java Swing - Simple Face Drawing

This Java program showcases a simple graphical application using Swing to draw a face. The graphical user interface consists of a JFrame titled "Face" and a custom JPanel named Face responsible for drawing the face elements.

**Face Class:**

1) Extends JPanel to create a custom panel for drawing.
2) Overrides the paintComponent method to draw a face with a circular outline, eyes, and a simple straight-line mouth.
3) Utilizes Graphics methods for drawing and styling, such as drawOval and drawLine.

**Main Class:**

1) Creates a JFrame titled "Face."
2) Sets up the frame with a size of 400x300 pixels.
3) Adds an instance of the Face class to the frame.
4) Displays the frame to visualize the drawn face.

The program serves as a basic introduction to Java Swing for graphical user interface development. It is suitable for educational purposes, especially for those learning about GUI programming or exploring basic drawing functionalities. Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the face drawing or experiment with additional graphical elements.
