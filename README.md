# Number-to-String Converter with 'w' Counter
This Java program utilizes a custom number-to-string converter (NumberToStringConvertor) to convert integers from 1 to 35 million into their word representation. The main goal is to count the occurrences of the letter 'w' in these word representations. The range includes the words "one" to "thirty-five million."

The CountW class contains the main method, which iterates through the specified range, converts each number to its word representation, and counts the occurrences of 'w' in each word. The final count is then displayed.
