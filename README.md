# Java Swing - Overlapping Squares

This Java program utilizes Swing to create a graphical application that displays two overlapping squares of different colors. The graphical user interface consists of a JFrame titled "Overlapping Squares" and a custom JPanel named OverLappingSquares responsible for drawing the squares.

**OverLappingSquares Class:**

1) Extends JPanel to create a custom panel for drawing.
2) Overrides the paintComponent method to draw two squares: one green and another yellow, which overlaps the green square.
3) Utilizes Graphics methods for drawing and styling, such as fillRect to draw filled rectangles.

**Main Class:**

1) Creates a JFrame titled "Overlapping Squares."
2) Sets up the frame with a size of 300x300 pixels.
3) Adds an instance of the OverLappingSquares class to the frame.
4) Displays the frame to visualize the overlapping squares.

The program provides a simple example of using Java Swing for GUI development, demonstrating how to draw shapes on a panel. It is suitable for educational purposes, especially for those learning about GUI programming or exploring basic drawing functionalities. Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different shapes, colors, or arrangements of overlapping elements.
