# Java Swing - Olympic Rings Drawing

This Java program uses the Swing framework to create a simple graphical representation of the Olympic rings. The application includes two classes: OlympicRings and Main.

**OlympicRings Class:**

1) Extends JPanel to create a custom drawing panel for the Olympic rings.
2) Overrides the paintComponent method to draw five rings of different colors.
3) Each ring is drawn using drawOval with specified positions and sizes.

**Main Class:**

1) Contains the main method to initiate the program.
2) Creates a JFrame with the title "Olympic Rings" and sets up the frame properties.
3) Adds an instance of the OlympicRings class to the frame for rendering the rings.
4) Displays the frame to visualize the Olympic rings.

Usage:

The program creates a window displaying the iconic Olympic rings in different colors. Users can run the application to view the graphical representation of the rings. It serves as a simple example for those learning about Java Swing graphics and provides a foundation for more complex graphical applications.
